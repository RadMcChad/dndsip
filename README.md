Problem: Current D&D web apps are often clunky, non-intuitive, and hard to use.

Goal: Create a Simple, Intuitive, Paperless (SIP) web app that lets players create and save character sheets as well as roll dice.

Goal: Help DMs track information and fluidly run combat scenarios with an initiative tracker and note-taking space.
